            <p>I am an MS student in the Aerospace Engineering Sciens department at CU boulder.
                I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor
                of Applied Science in Computer Science and Mathematics (minor). Prior to pursuing graduate stuides, I
                worked as a software engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) for three years.
            </p>
            <p>My MS research focuses on advancing autonomous systems using machine learning techniques that enable them
                to operate efficiently in novel and uncertain situations</p>
